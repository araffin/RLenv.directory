Datasets are a major force in the machine learning strategy. Processing capacity, algorithms and data define the evolution of the field.

Learning environments are the datasets of reinforcement learning, they can be seen as simulations of real life processes, simple or complex. A key piece for progress in the field of reinforcement learning are new learning environments. 

Our mission is to encourage the creation of new and more complex learning environments by making their discovery easy.

## Contributing

All learning environments are stored in a easy to edit json file, steps for adding a new environment are:

1. Forking the repository
2. Adding the environment to "/data/envs.json"
3. Opening a pull request

## Bug Reports

All issue reports are welcome, more detailed guidelines will be added soon.
